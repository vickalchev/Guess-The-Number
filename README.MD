# Guess The Number

## Description

Create a game where the user guesses a number from 1 to 100. The user enters a number in an input field in the DOM and clicks on a button "Check Result". The JS script takes the number and compares it with a randomly generated number using `Math.random`. If the input number matches the random number, then the user wins a prize. If not, they get a message "Try Again".

## Objective

The purpose of this exercise is to practice DOM manipulation:

- Taking an input from a field (input field);
- Assessing the input (whether it matches a random number);
- Writing to the DOM depending on the result of the test.
